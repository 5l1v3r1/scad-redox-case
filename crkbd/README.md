## CRKBD keyboard Case From Scratch

This is work in progress on a case for the
[Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard. It is a top plate
with tenting supports attached. The bottom plate could be 3D printed in
transparent plastic (or should be compatible with laser cut acrylic
bottom plate).
