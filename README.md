# A modified case for the Redox keyboard

The [Redox](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2704567) keyboard is a DIY mechanical 
keyboard by MattDB. It is sort of a cross between an 
[Iris](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard) and an 
[Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/).

This repository uses OpenSCAD to make some modifications to the original STL to add
tenting etc.

When cloning, you need to make sure you get the submodules, e.g.:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Lenbok/scad-redox-case.git

Load the redox_body.scad into OpenSCAD, make any changes, and render the modified STL.
