# A modified case for the Redox keyboard

The [Redox](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) keyboard is a DIY mechanical 
keyboard by MattDB. It is sort of a cross between an 
[Iris](https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard) and an 
[Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/).

This repository uses OpenSCAD to make some modifications to the original STL to add
tenting etc.

This was my first modification of the original handwire redox case. Load the
`redox-body-mod.scad` into OpenSCAD, make any changes, and render the
modified STL.

This one has been built by a few people, e.g: [by me](https://imgur.com/a/DzFYMhc), 
and [a coworker](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:486818)
